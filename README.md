A web-based tool for analyzing customer preferences across different areas to help you identify optimal combinations of favorites to stock in each location.

## Overview

## How to Use

1. View the "Customer Coverage Analysis" section for optimal favorite combinations
2. Use the filters on the left to narrow down results:
   - Filter by Area to focus on specific locations
   - Filter by Standards to focus on customer quality levels
   - Filter by Favorites to see who prefers specific products
3. Toggle between "Match all" or "Match any" mode for favorite filters
4. Use the search bar to find specific customers by name
5. The analysis will update automatically based on your filter selections

## Setup

For best results, run the application using a local web server. This ensures that JSON files load correctly:

### Using Python (Recommended)

1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory
2. Run one of these commands depending on your Python version:

   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8080    # Python 3
   python3 -m http.server 8080   # Alternative for Python 3
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080    # Python 2
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

### Direct Opening (Not Recommended)

Simply opening `index.html` directly in a browser may not work properly due to browser security restrictions preventing JSON files from loading when using the `file://` protocol.

## Data Structure

The application uses two JSON files:

- `data.json`: Contains customer information including names, areas, standards, and favorites
- `colors.json`: Maps favorite types to specific colors for visual representation
